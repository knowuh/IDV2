    <h2>George Nees <i>Eight Corner, or 8-Ecke</i> (1968)</h2>
        <p>"The automaton as <i>creativity stimulant</i>? A mental concept which one can only consider cautiously and which however can call in question all the hitherto binding definitions of the inviolability of the human creative capacity.Looking at the multi-patterned constructions in Nees' graphics, with their floating ellipsoids, crystalloid spheres and bizarre forms, one cannot help but acknowledge and appreciate their atmospheric and inspiration-inducing effects." - Eva Karcher, on Georg Nees</p>
        <p>Nees studied mathematics, physics, and philosophy at the University of Erlangen.</p>
        <p>Nees became the first to exhibit what then was called computer art, <i>computergrafik</i> in German or, better, algorithmic art.</p>
        <p>His doctoral thesis was published as a book in 1969 (under the title, <i>Generative Computergrafik</i>). This was in all likelihood world-wide the first doctoral thesis on a topic of computer art.</p>
