* Review print
* Review digital

## 6:10 – 6:30 Question time (L & C rescheduled):

* What kinds of things are you doing in other classes?
* What do you wish you were learning?
* What do you the weekly problem sets?
* Problems? (address issues after break)

## 6:30 BREAK

## 6:40-7:20 Discussions
#### [Powers of 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKBhvDjuy0)
Is this data visualization?
#### [Up and Down the Ladder of Abstraction](http://worrydream.com/#!2/LadderOfAbstraction)
Is this data visualization?
#### Angry Tufte:

#### Google Cardboard
Could this be used for visualization? Examples of projects it might be suited for?

## 7:10 - 7:20 BREAK

## 7:30 – 8:00 D3, and our survey data:
* Access data in arrays, the notation `array[i]`
* Accessing data in objects, the notation `object.distance` or `object[distance]`
* From web JSON and web services, as per [survey.js](js/survey.js)

## 8:00 – 8:45:


## Problem Set 03 (ps-03) "Survey Data"
### Reading:
* Books: some d3 reference book might be good.
    * [D3.js in action](http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com.ezproxy.neu.edu/book/programming/javascript/9781617292118) isn't a great book, but we have free access to it.
    * Decent book, probably worth trying to get a kindle version [Interactive Data Visualization for the Web](http://www.amazon.com/Interactive-Data-Visualization-Scott-Murray/dp/1449339735)
* [Florian Cramer
Concepts, Notations, Software, Art](http://www.netzliteratur.net/cramer/concepts_notations_software_art.html)
* Anthropology: [code at auction](https://www.artsy.net/auction/the-algorithm-auction)

### Problems:
On the first day of class, we created data using google spreadsheet survey's. I demonstrated a very simple and [uninspired D3 plot](../survey.html) of our data. This week, I you will revise my work and create two new compositions.

Please choose two radically different approaches in your two solutions.

Some Ideas: Are you going to show multiple values, or focus on just one? What is the smallest most efficient representation for this data? What is an abstract representation? A text only representation?

Please create a new folder `<username>/ps-03/index.html` and have it point to each of your solutions for these problems (a,b):
