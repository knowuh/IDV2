# Class 05 –  Feb 22  2016:

## Projects in Social Visualization
Less coffee. Less firehose. More collaboration.

### Some answers:
* You don't need to use D3 in your final projects.  Your projects must be published online.  They can also exist as posters.
* API anxiety: We will be working with a (relatively) small number of API's. We will build tools together to consume, store and pre-process API data.
* Your projects can be whimsical, or scholarly. But they must be polished, and something that you and
* Working with few constraints can make some people anxious. We will develop a 'unified' topic and dataset together in class. You are encouraged to think outside the box.
* Going forward classes are going to be more like a study group or workshop.

### Rescheduled Presentations:
We need to reschedule all our presentations. New schedule:
* Feb 22: Lucy and Cara
* Feb 29: Lorzenzo and Sever
* Mar 14: June and Andrew
* Mar 28: Kimi and Jiani
* Apr  4: Jessie and Patric
* Mar 28: Ryan

### Project dimensions and scope. Its OK to Dream, but constraints are good.
* Static vs Interactive
* Exploratory vs Narrative
* Anecdotal vs Scientific
* Historic vs Live

### Working with data
* Collect Data (was: CSV files, or XML, now: JSON from an API)
* Combine data (merge multiple records into one)
    * Add sentiment
    * Add image tags
    * Dig into responses, likes, retweets … &etc.
* Filter. Pluck. Summarize.
* Reshape. Make the data conform to your visualization needs.
* Display in a web browser.

### Exciting Development: Images data:
* [Google Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/)
* Exif Data (iPhoto)

###  We can use data from social media to tell us a story about any subject we find interesting. Examples:
* The spread of the Zika virus. Use geographic data over time to see if where in the world people are most concerned about Zika.
*  The presidential primary races.  Sentiment analysis, tweet frequency, and tweet reach as a proxy for candidates popularity. Does this match other polls?

### Can we use data from social media to tell us a story about social media? Examples:
* Explore the factors that lead to tweets that generate the most impressions.
* Which images are the most retweeted by region?
* Who are the most followed personalities on twitter? How do their status updates differ (frequency, word-frequency, sentiment, media)?  What time of the day do they tweet?

### Make untested claims about social media and its use:
* What are the unique characteristics of social media?
* How do we think social media impacts:
    * Communication / Community
    * News
    * Our physical presence
    * Privacy and safety
    * Law enforcement & Justice
    * Power dynamics
* Characterize and differentiate these social communities:
    * Facebook
    * Instagram
    * Snapchat
    * Twitter
    * Flickr

### Look at work
* Look at D3 visualization ps-03 assignments
* Look at final project sketches.
    * How achievable?
    * Existing related work?
    * Whats interesting about it?

### Working & Questions
Get started on modifications to your project proposal.

### Problem set 05:
Project Proposal. Bring in 1 or 2 project proposals for next week.  Do the layout for both in HTML / CSS. The purpose of this proposal is to make us believe. It is acceptable at this phase to have large fake images (jpg?). Use 'click-handling' fakery to give us a sense of the UI.


## Snow Day Slack Links:

## Items from last week:
* I have started to archive posts containing certain twitter hash tags. If you have some tags you want me to start archiving from twitter, **please let me know**.
*You can work with data from [flickr](https://www.flickr.com/services/developer/api/), [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/developer/), [twitter](https://dev.twitter.com/overview/documentation), or [google+](https://developers.google.com/+/web/api/rest/latest/). I am currently only capturing tweets, but can add other services.
* Advanced: We can post-process social message data for example to [extract sentiment](http://text-processing.com/demo/sentiment/).
* Read this recent paper by danah boyd. [What World Are We Building?](http://www.danah.org/papers/talks/2015/ParkerLecture.html) - danah has been researching online behavior and critiquing social media for more than 10 years. Her primary concern is about online youth, but her work is generally applicable.
* Lev Mannovich has been doing interesting experiments with large volumes of instagram images. See for example [The Exceptional and the Everyday: 144 hours in Kyiv](http://manovich.net/index.php/projects/hours-in-kiev-copy)
* TODO: Help me review this big list of recommended journal articles on Big Data. A few papers and sections may be of interest, though I have not vetted any of them yet: http://www.cs.nyu.edu/faculty/davise/papers/BigDataBib.html
* Do some independent research when trying to identify a topic. It would be great to share in-process thoughts, or interesting papers / visualizations with the group in slack along the way. Here are some (half-baked) idea launch pads if you need some inspiration.
    * [Twitter Bots](http://qz.com/279139/the-17-best-bots-on-twitter/), especially bots that make images. ★
    * SEO / Brand management, engagement, spam.
    * [Richard Price and the Suicide Grils](http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/may/27/suicide-girls-richard-prince-copying-instagram)
    * [Images, privacy and the abuse(http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/12/technology/personaltech/12basics.html?_r=0) of [exif data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchangeable_image_file_format).
    * clickbait, A/B testing, the echo chamber and the decline of mainstream media.
    * For-hire followers, paid engagement, cpc rates, and add bidding.
    * The role of social media in political change.
    * Hate speach and the attention marketplace. Trolls.
    * Metrics of social influence, and the hyperconnected.
    *Comparing trends between multiple social media outlets, and broadcast / mainstream media.
    * Mapping social trends. (Note; generally most tweets don't contain lat / long data. Sometimes it can be extacted in other ways).



## Git Help
If you are continually running into troubles with git, consider reviewing some of these:

* [Here are some beautiful tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/undoing-changes/) for using git from the command line.  Spending some time with it should help you feel more comfortable. We are basically using the ['feature branch' model](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow/) for our collaboration.

* I also uploaded this 8 [minute video](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/73403/githubdesktop.mp4), explaining how we should be using the desktop client to manage our files.

* Previously I had recommend that people review the [no deep $#t git guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/).  I think now that I prefer the [Atlassian git tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/).
