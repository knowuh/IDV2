<ul>
<li>I have started to archive posts containing certain twitter hash tags. If you have some tags you want me to start archiving from twitter, <strong>please let me know</strong>.
*You can work with data from <a href="https://www.flickr.com/services/developer/api/">flickr</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/developer/">instagram</a>, <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/overview/documentation">twitter</a>, or <a href="https://developers.google.com/+/web/api/rest/latest/">google+</a>. I am currently only capturing tweets, but can add other services.</li>
<li>Advanced: We can post-process social message data for example to <a href="http://text-processing.com/demo/sentiment/">extract sentiment</a>.</li>
<li>Read this recent paper by danah boyd. <a href="http://www.danah.org/papers/talks/2015/ParkerLecture.html">What World Are We Building?</a> - danah has been researching online behavior and critiquing social media for more than 10 years. Her primary concern is about online youth, but her work is generally applicable.</li>
<li>Lev Mannovich has been doing interesting experiments with large volumes of instagram images. See for example <a href="http://manovich.net/index.php/projects/hours-in-kiev-copy">The Exceptional and the Everyday: 144 hours in Kyiv</a></li>
<li>TODO: Help me review this big list of recommended journal articles on Big Data. A few papers and sections may be of interest, though I have not vetted any of them yet: <a href="http://www.cs.nyu.edu/faculty/davise/papers/BigDataBib.html">http://www.cs.nyu.edu/faculty/davise/papers/BigDataBib.html</a></li>
<li>Do some independent research when trying to identify a topic. It would be great to share in-process thoughts, or interesting papers / visualizations with the group in slack along the way. Here are some (half-baked) idea launch pads if you need some inspiration.<ul>
<li><a href="http://qz.com/279139/the-17-best-bots-on-twitter/">Twitter Bots</a>, especially bots that make images. ★</li>
<li>SEO / Brand management, engagement, spam.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/may/27/suicide-girls-richard-prince-copying-instagram">Richard Price and the Suicide Grils</a></li>

<li>clickbait, A/B testing, the echo chamber and the decline of mainstream media.</li>
<li>For-hire followers, paid engagement, cpc rates, and add bidding.</li>
<li>The role of social media in political change.</li>
<li>Hate speach and the attention marketplace. Trolls.</li>
<li>Metrics of social influence, and the hyperconnected.
*Comparing trends between multiple social media outlets, and broadcast / mainstream media.</li>
<li>Mapping social trends. (Note; generally most tweets don&#39;t contain lat / long data. Sometimes it can be extacted in other ways).</li>

<p>If you are continually running into troubles with git, consider reviewing some of these:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/undoing-changes/">Here are some beautiful tutorials</a> for using git from the command line.  Spending some time with it should help you feel more comfortable. We are basically using the <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow/">&#39;feature branch&#39; model</a> for our collaboration.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I also uploaded this 8 <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/73403/githubdesktop.mp4">minute video</a>, explaining how we should be using the desktop client to manage our files.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Previously I had recommend that people review the <a href="http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/">no deep $#t git guide</a>.  I think now that I prefer the <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/">Atlassian git tutorials</a>.</p>
