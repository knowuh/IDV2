<h3 id="look-at-project-proposals-">Look at project proposals.</h3>
<p>Identify intention.</p>
<p>What phenomenon are you exploring? What features are you expecting to uncover? Who has done related work? If this work is narrative then What is the story you are trying to tell? If the work is editorial: What perspectives are you taking? what are the some alternate perspectives? If the objective is analytical: What is being measured? What is being ignored?</p>
<p>Start with your ideal visual representation and work backwards towards the data. What would the data need to look like to implement your vision? Think about feature mapping. What features do you care the most about? How are they represented?</p>
<p>Can you answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who cares? (iishi)</li>
<li>Static vs. Interactive</li>
<li>Exploratory vs. Narrative</li>
<li>Anecdotal vs. Scientific</li>
<li>Historic vs. Live</li>
<li>Related works and precedent?</li>
<li>Where and how will you publish?</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="work-in-class-and-problem-set-06-challenges-">Work in class and Problem Set 06: Challenges.</h4>
<p>You will be expected to present some challenges in class next week. Your response can be PDF, Text, or Web page. After answering the questions, you prepare another revision of your design, addressing any concerns raised in class.</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify next steps in your project. Enumerate and prioritize what you need to complete your project. The biggest challenges and unknowns should be put at the top of the list.</li>
<li>For each challenge spend 5-10 minutes thinking of a <em>plan-b</em>. Would you be able to rework your project? What would it look like with these change?</li>
<li>For each challenge, can you identify someone in class, or a close friend outside of class who might be able to help?</li>
<li>For each challenge, spend up to one hour doing initial research. Does the problem look solvable? What are the biggest &#39;pieces&#39; of the problem? Write down the online resources available to solve this problem.</li>
