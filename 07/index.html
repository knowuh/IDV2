<p>We will be working in class on our projects. You should have identified your greatest challenges, and should have a concrete list.</p>
<p>Your challenges can be PDF, Text, or a web page. After answering the questions, you prepare another revision of your design, addressing any concerns raised in class.</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify next steps in your project. Enumerate and prioritize what you need to complete your project. The biggest challenges and unknowns should be put at the top of the list.</li>
<li>For each challenge spend 5-10 minutes thinking of a <em>plan-b</em>. Would you be able to rework your project? What would it look like with these change?</li>
<li>For each challenge, can you identify someone in class, or a close friend outside of class who might be able to help?</li>
<li>For each challenge, spend up to one hour doing initial research. Does the problem look solvable? What are the biggest &#39;pieces&#39; of the problem? Write down the online resources available to solve this problem.</li>
