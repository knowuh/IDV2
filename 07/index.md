#### Work in class challenges.
We will be working in class on our projects. You should have identified your greatest challenges, and should have a concrete list.


Your challenges can be PDF, Text, or a web page. After answering the questions, you prepare another revision of your design, addressing any concerns raised in class.

1. Identify next steps in your project. Enumerate and prioritize what you need to complete your project. The biggest challenges and unknowns should be put at the top of the list.
2. For each challenge spend 5-10 minutes thinking of a _plan-b_. Would you be able to rework your project? What would it look like with these change?
3. For each challenge, can you identify someone in class, or a close friend outside of class who might be able to help?
4. For each challenge, spend up to one hour doing initial research. Does the problem look solvable? What are the biggest 'pieces' of the problem? Write down the online resources available to solve this problem.

#### Questions to consider:
* What kind of data are you exploring?
    * Where do you get it?
    * What dimensions does it have?
    * Is some data missing?
* Framing:
    * Over what time period?
    * Categorized by what?
    * Sorted by what?
    * Compared to what?
    * Where / who?
    * How much data do you have or care to work with?
    * Can we 'dig in' to find out more?
    * Can this visualization be personalized or customized?
