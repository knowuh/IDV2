<p>Its a preview and pitch. The purpose is to focus, refine, and to present an intermediate deliverable. We will call this an &#39;aspirational prototype&#39;. Use an &#39;outside-in&#39; design process, and button-down what you have. Your design can be in PDF or SVG form, but it must be accompanied by a a web page that &#39;surrounds&#39; the material in a meaningful, and compelling way.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Criteria for grade:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Strength of pitch: 75-100 words which clearly conveys your agenda. Groom these words. Be explicit about intentions and audience. You will be expected to deliver the essence of this with confidence in person (internalize the words). You may have questions and doubts, <em>but your pitch is not the place for it</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Clarity of presentation. Your prototype should convey what the final project <em>will</em> do even without the pitch text. How will data be displayed? What affordances are obvious in the interface? Create an interface that suggest any possible final interaction.</p>
</li>
<li>Bonus: prototypes that include SVG / CSS / HTML.</li>
<li>Bonus: prototypes that are interactive.</li>
<li>Bonus: prototypes that include javascript (d3 / processing) and use some JSON data. (Data may be fabricated, faked, or canned).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Delivery:  Ideally, submit these using git pull requests. If that is daunting, or taking more than 10 minutes, email me a zip file containing your work. I can put them up for you. Submit before <strong>9:00 am Monday</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="work-in-class-for-one-hour-on-prototype-for-prototype-">Work in class for one hour on prototype for Prototype:</h3>
<ul>
<li>30 minutes on 75-100 words</li>
<li>30 minutes on visuals</li>
</ul>
<p>We will spend 1-2 minutes listening to each pitch, and looking at the design without comment.  After we have seen all the pitches we will spend ~20 minutes commenting on what we thought could be tightened up.</p>
<h3 id="armed-with-feedback-continue-working-on-next-weeks-prototype-">Armed with feedback, continue working on next weeks prototype.</h3>
<p>During this time we can also work together on existing technical challenges.</p>
