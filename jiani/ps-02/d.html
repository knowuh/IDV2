<h2>

    The Art work, "LETTRES DE MA MERE",1988 Letters from My Mother, Molnar simulates the handwriting of her mother as
    it appeared in a series of weekly letters she received, using the computer to reconcile  the off-balance and irregular
    orientation of the script.The drawings were done with the help of a computer and a plotter, and later a printer.
    The latter show the overlapping of plotter-tracing and actual handwriting, suggesting a dialogue between human and machine.
