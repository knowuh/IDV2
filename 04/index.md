Northeastern has canceled day and evening classes Today. No class for us until Feb 22. I live near the Cape, and could easily loose power. I will make an effort to be available on slack Today from 6:00pm - 9:00pm for virtual office hours. Virtual attendance is not required.
I will post an update to our class website later this afternoon.

## Final Projects:

You should starting planning your final projects topics. On the 22nd we will be reviewing rough drafts of proposals. Bring in 2 proposal ideas per person. These can are rough pitches, one paragraph, and a few thumnail sketches for each proposal.
* I have started to archive posts containing certain twitter hash tags. If you have some tags you want me to start archiving from twitter, **please let me know**.
*You can work with data from [flickr](https://www.flickr.com/services/developer/api/), [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/developer/), [twitter](https://dev.twitter.com/overview/documentation), or [google+](https://developers.google.com/+/web/api/rest/latest/). I am currently only capturing tweets, but can add other services.
* Advanced: We can post-process social message data for example to [extract sentiment](http://text-processing.com/demo/sentiment/).
* To get situated in social media topics, read this recent paper by danah boyd. [What World Are We Building?](http://www.danah.org/papers/talks/2015/ParkerLecture.html) - danah has been researching online behavior and critiquing social media for more than 10 years. Her primary concern is about online youth, but her work is generally applicable.
* Lev Mannovich has been doing interesting experiments with large volumes of instagram images. See for example [The Exceptional and the Everyday: 144 hours in Kyiv](http://manovich.net/index.php/projects/hours-in-kiev-copy)
* Big list of recommended journal articles on Big Data. A few papers and sections may be of interest, though I have not vetted any of them yet: http://www.cs.nyu.edu/faculty/davise/papers/BigDataBib.html
* Do some independent research when trying to identify a topic. It would be great to share in-process thoughts, or interesting papers / visualizations with the group in slack along the way. Here are some (half-baked) idea launch pads if you need some inspiration.
    * [Twitter Bots](http://qz.com/279139/the-17-best-bots-on-twitter/), especially bots that make images. ★
    * SEO / Brand management, engagement, spam.
    * [Richard Price and the Suicide Grils](http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/may/27/suicide-girls-richard-prince-copying-instagram)
    * [Images, privacy and the abuse(http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/12/technology/personaltech/12basics.html?_r=0) of [exif data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchangeable_image_file_format).
    * clickbait, A/B testing, the echo chamber and the decline of mainstream media.
    * For-hire followers, paid engagement, cpc rates, and add bidding.
    * The role of social media in political change.
    * Hate speach and the attention marketplace. Trolls.
    * Metrics of social influence, and the hyperconnected.
    *Comparing trends between multiple social media outlets, and broadcast / mainstream media.
    * Mapping social trends. (Note; generally most tweets don't contain lat / long data. Sometimes it can be extacted in other ways).


If you are continually running into troubles with git, consider reviewing some of these:

* [Here are some beautiful tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/undoing-changes/) for using git from the command line.  Spending some time with it should help you feel more comfortable. We are basically using the ['feature branch' model](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow/) for our collaboration.

* I also uploaded this 8 [minute video](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/73403/githubdesktop.mp4), explaining how we should be using the desktop client to manage our files.

* Previously I had recommend that people review the [no deep $#t git guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/).  I think now that I prefer the [Atlassian git tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/).
