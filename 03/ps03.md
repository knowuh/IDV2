### Reading:
* Books: some d3 reference book might be good.
    * [D3.js in action](http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com.ezproxy.neu.edu/book/programming/javascript/9781617292118) isn't a great book, but we have free access to it.
    * Decent book, probably worth trying to get a kindle version [Interactive Data Visualization for the Web](http://www.amazon.com/Interactive-Data-Visualization-Scott-Murray/dp/1449339735)
* [Florian Cramer
Concepts, Notations, Software, Art](http://www.netzliteratur.net/cramer/concepts_notations_software_art.html)
* Anthropology: [code at auction](https://www.artsy.net/auction/the-algorithm-auction)

### Problems:
On the first day of class, we created data using google spreadsheet survey's. I demonstrated a very simple and [uninspired D3 plot](./survey.html) of our data. This week, I you will revise my work and create two new compositions.

Please choose two radically different approaches in your two solutions.

Some Ideas: Are you going to show multiple values, or focus on just one? What is the smallest most efficient representation for this data? What is an abstract representation? A text only representation?

Please create a new folder `<username>/ps-03/index.html` and have it point to each of your solutions for these problems (a,b):

### Solutions:

<script>
$(document).ready(function () {
   solutions("ps-03");
});
</script>
