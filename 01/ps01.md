## Problem Set 01:  Hello circles

__Due Jan 25th (14 days)__

This challenge will get you familiar with tools and process we will be using throughout the course. Even though these are technical lessons, __design, presentation, and defense__ are critical. Please do not use colors for this problem set. Work in greyscale for now.

#### Reading:
- Read [The problemset guide](../ps-guide.html)
- Read [Social rules for learning](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules)
- Read [Git guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)

#### PS01 a: "Hello World"
In the world of software engineering there is time-honored tradition of creating simple "hello world" programs.  These programs verify a properly configured working environment. In our case, this means being able to use Github, CSS, and HTML to publish something online.

* Create a web page `<username>/ps-01/index.html` that will function as an index for your ps01 solutions. (5pts)
* Create a web page `<username>/ps-01/a.html`. This page should simple display "Hello World".
* Create a print on 8.5" x 11" plain paper. This page should simply read "Hello World". (5pts)

#### PS01 b-d: "Nine circles"
You are challenged to create three compositions, each consisting  of three circles. (3x3). Each composition should take a different technological approach to drawing circles. Some example approaches: scaled and positioned type, SVG, Canvas, WebGL, embedded images, unusual CSS.

* Create a web page `<username>/ps-01/b.html`. This page should display three circles. (5pts)
* Create a web page `<username>/ps-01/c.html`. This page should display three circles. (5pts)
* Create a web page `<username>/ps-01/d.html`. This page should display three circles. (5pts)
