### Midterm Project Review

We have **three** classes, and **four** weeks before final projects are due.

Today is a preview of your final project, and a brief pitch. This is an aspirational prototype. Your design can be in PDF or SVG form, but it must be accompanied by a a web page that 'surrounds' the material in a meaningful, and compelling way.

- Criteria for grade:
    - Strength of pitch: 75-100 words which clearly conveys your agenda. Groom these words. Be explicit about intentions and audience. You will be expected to deliver the essence of this with confidence in person (internalize the words). You may have questions and doubts, _but your pitch is not the place for it_.

    - Clarity of presentation. Your prototype should convey what the final project *will* do even without the pitch text. How will data be displayed? What affordances are obvious in the interface? Create an interface that suggest any possible final interaction.
    - Prototypes delivered (in part) in SVG / CSS / HTML.
    - Bonus: prototypes that are interactive.
    - Bonus: prototypes that include javascript (d3 / processing) and use some JSON data. (Data may be fabricated, faked, or canned).
